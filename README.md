# Description:

🪞**Mirror, Mirror**🪞 is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), user friendly application that is geared towards mental health and overall-wellness.

The goal of 🪞**Mirror, Mirror**🪞 is to allow the user that they are not alone and to empower the user to seek the help they need as well as provide resources on a local and national level. The app includes the **ACE Quiz** which is a quiz to see how childhood trauma impacts ones lives as well as the predisposed disposition towards incarceration.

The categories covered in 🪞**Mirror, Mirror** 🪞: Mental Health, Justice Impacted Information, Local and National Resources, Over-All Wellness, Physical Health, as well as the ability to allow the user to leave a comment and leave a review of not only the website but also the resources too.
